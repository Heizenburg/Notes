Python ENV

1- Install Ananconda (on the final installation page, you can de-select both boxes)

2- Open Anaconda prompt

3- Type: conda install ipykernel
   This is a package that you'll need to work with notebooks in VScode

VSCODE ENV 

1- Install 'Python' extension

Python ENV 2)

Install Anaconda
Set the channel priority to strict to avoid issues with the environment creation taking forever.
> conda config --set channel_priority strict
Run the following commands (in either the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt):
> conda env create -f golden_scenario_env.yml
> conda activate golden_scenario_env
> conda install python=3.7
In VS Code, open the Titanic.ipynb file and connect to the golden_scenario_env kernel
You need to setup the environment as an ipykernel to use it from the Jupyter notebook. To do it run inside of the conda activated environment:

python -m ipykernel install --user --name golden_scenario_env --display-name "Golden Scenario Env"

Also if you want to support PDF export from jupyter you need to setup LaTeX:

sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-plain-generic

NB: Install pip/pip3 packages using your anaconda prompt. IE) Check the Python environment: If you are using virtual environments (e.g., venv or conda), ensure that you have activated the correct environment where the twilio module is installed. Activate the environment using the appropriate command for your environment.
